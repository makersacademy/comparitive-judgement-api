## Running with Docker
-- In Progress --

Currently, we have the ability to build a container that will run the API with some hard-coded values. To do this:

- Install Docker
- In the root of the repository, run the command `docker build . -t comparative-judgement-api`
- Once it has built, run the command `docker run -p 8080:8080 -t comparative-judgement-api`
(Note, this does not work for me when I try and run it with the tags but does run when I use the random string that is generated by "docker build .") -Bertie
- Visit http://localhost:8080/compare to validate that your API is up and running
